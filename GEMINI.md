# Project: Coot Club Frontend

## Context
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Uses hooks for API calls (currently mocked)
- Needs real backend integration with REST endpoints (per Jules Audit)
- Authentication required: username/password with RBAC roles (user, manager, admin)
- Focus on strong typing and removing 'any' types
- Follow accessibility best practices (e.g., alt tags)
- Avoid use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML for security
- Optimize bundle size (lazy load heavy deps like recharts)
- Testing with Jest and React Testing Library

## Non-negotiables
- Never modify .env or config files
- Always keep backups before bulk edits
